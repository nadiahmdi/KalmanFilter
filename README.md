# Kalman Filter Ball Trajectory Estimation
## Introduction
### The Kalman filter is a powerful tool for estimating the state of a system from noisy observations. In this project, we use the Kalman filter to estimate the trajectory of a ball. We simulate the true trajectory of the ball, add noise to the observations, simulate observation dropouts, and use the Kalman filter to estimate the ball's position over time.
